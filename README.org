* Bug

A byte-compiled lisp implementation that is similar to Common Lisp, but with less features.

* Building 
** Windows
To build on Windows with MinGW run:

#+BEGIN_SRC cmd
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
#+END_SRC

If there is an error saying CMAKE_C_COMPILER is not set, make sure
to add an environment variable called "CC" with a path to your c compiler (probably C:\MinGW\bin\gcc.exe).
This requires that you have "make" installed with MinGW and "gcc".

You also need to have libffi installed somewhere in your path.

I already had Strawberry Perl installed, so I just took the libffi.a, ffi.h, and ffitarget.h, and put them in the appropriate MinGW directories (/include and /lib) and it worked.

* Types
Common Lisp has type specifiers which supports complex expressions, and has separate types for its FFI.
Right now, Bug has one set of types that are used for both. How can I get type expressions and keep this?
