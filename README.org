* Bug

A byte-compiled lisp implementation that is similar to Common Lisp, but with less features.

* Building 
** Windows
To build on Windows with MinGW run:

#+BEGIN_SRC cmd
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
#+END_SRC

If there is an error saying CMAKE_C_COMPILER is not set, make sure
to add an environment variable called "CC" with a path to your c compiler (probably C:\MinGW\bin\gcc.exe).
This requires that you have "make" installed with MinGW and "gcc".

You also need to have libffi installed somewhere in your path.

I already had Strawberry Perl installed, so I just took the libffi.a, ffi.h, and ffitarget.h, and put them in the appropriate MinGW directories (/include and /lib) and it worked.
